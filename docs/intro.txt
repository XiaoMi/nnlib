Because of our current runtime environment, and because of the RPC semantics, 
this library is implemented as plain C, not C++.

This library allows a program to build a graph (or subgraph), and then execute
the graph multiple times on the DSP.  A graph preparation pass is required
between graph construction and graph execution, which allows for the graph
to be prepared for optimized execution.

In order to aid in compatibility detection, the API:

	int32_t hexagon_nn_version(int *version)

will set the memory at *version to an API version, and return 0 on success.
Failure of this function typically means that the hexagon_nn library could
not be loaded for some reason.


Before creating a graph, it is recommended to allow the environment on the
DSP to configure some settings.  So before creating any new graphs, it is 
recommended that you call:

	int32_t hexagon_nn_config();

While this function has no program effect, it may help performance or the
ability to allocate large amounts of memory.

It returns zero.

A new graph can be initialized with:

	nn_id hexagon_nn_init();

This creates a new graph and returns an identifier to refer to the new graph.
When a graph is created, it can not be executed, but it can be added to.  
Multiple graphs can be created and can be kept "alive" in the DSP environment
simultaneously.

Once a graph is initialized, you can do three operations at any time until the
graph is torn down.  These are:

	void hexagon_nn_snpprint(nn_id id, char *buf, uint32_t length);

This function pretty-prints the graph into the provided buffer.

	void hexagon_nn_getlog(nn_id id, char *buf, uint32_t length);

This function copies the log messages into the provided buffer, and resets the
internal log buffer.

	void hexagon_nn_set_debug_level(nn_id id, int level);

This function will change the debug verbosity level for messages.

After a graph is initialized, nodes can be added to it.




It seems as though the sizes of the tensors are not necessarily known at the time
we instantiate the ops, and so each node determines how much work to do based on 
the sizes of the input tensors it observes at execute time.  I'm not sure
that's a requirement, but I've mostly kept that ability in the strawman
proposal below.  However I do require that a maximum size for output data is
given to me so that I know how much to allocate.  If that's not important and 
sizes are always fixed it might be a little easier to work with fixed sizes.


First, we'll have an initialization function:

	nn_id hexagon_nn_init();

Which will prepare to begin definition of a new graph.

The return value is an identifier that can refer to the graph.  This will be used
to be able to have multiple graphs alive simultaneously.

NN_ID_INVALID is returned for error.

Once a graph is initialized, you can do two operations until the graph is torn down:

The most useful is:

	void hexagon_nn_snpprint(nn_id id, char *buf, uint32_t length);

which pretty-prints the graph into the provided buffer.

The next most useful is:

	void hexagon_nn_set_debug_level(nn_id id, int level);

Which will change the debug verbosity level for a graph.


For connections between nodes, a single data type is supported. It contains:
	* Four dimensions: batches, height, width, and depth.  Depth is most-major.
	* A pointer to data

Scalar values may be defined as BHWD=1,1,1,1. 

Shapes may be defined by setting data to NULL.

After a graph is initialized, nodes can be added to it.  Nodes are executed in
the order they are added, so the creation order is important.  There are two
functions to append nodes to the graph.

Const nodes are added with:

	int hexagon_nn_append_const_node(
		nn_id id,
		uint32_t node_id,
		uint32_t batches,
		uint32_t height,
		uint32_t width,
		uint32_t depth,
		const char *data,
		uint32_t data_length);

Const nodes have a single output, and the output is always the
batches/height/width/depth/data value provided.

Other nodes are appended with:

	typedef enum {
		NN_PAD_NA,
		NN_PAD_SAME,
		NN_PAD_VALID,
	} padding_type;

	typedef struct {
		uint32_t src_id;
		uint32_t output_idx;
	} hexagon_nn_input;

	typedef struct {
		uint32_t max_size;
		uint32_t unused;
	} hexagon_nn_output;

	int hexagon_nn_append_node(
		nn_id id,
		uint32_t node_id,
		uint32_t operation,
		padding_type padding,
		const hexagon_nn_input *inputs,
		uint32_t n_inputs,
		const hexagon_nn_output *outputs,
		uint32_t n_outputs);

Each node requires an identifier number to be able to refer to nodes.  The
identifier is selected by the caller, but Node ID 0 and Node IDS > 0xF000_0000
are reserved.

Non-Const nodes may have zero or more inputs and zero or more outputs.  An
input is described as a source node ID as well as an output index to refer to
which one of several outputs a node may have.  An output is described with a
maximum size.  The true size of an output can be computed dynamically, but the
maximum amount of data storage required by the output must be defined by the
caller.

Operations can also have a padding option.  If padding does not apply, chose
NN_PAD_NA.  For nodes that can have padding, the caller may choose SAME or
VALID padding.  SAME padding means the output size should be roughly the SAME
as the input, and VALID padding means that you should only use input values
that are VALID, which results in a smaller output size for larger filter
windows.

All operations create memory to capture all the information; the data does not
need to persist on the caller side.

Nodes can not be added after the network has been prepared for execution.

Returns 0 on success, nonzero otherwise.

	int hexagon_nn_prepare(nn_id id);

Prepares a network for execution.  This is required after all the nodes have been
appended, but before execution.  This provides a hook where memory can be
allocated, data can be rearranged, inputs and outputs can be linked up, 
and things in the graph could be optimized. 

Once a network has been prepared, it can no longer be appended to, but 
it can be executed.

Returns 0 on success, nonzero otherwise.

	int hexagon_nn_execute(nn_id id, 
		uint32_t batches_in, 
		uint32_t height_in, 
		uint32_t width_in, 
		uint32_t depth_in, 
		const void *data_in,
		uint32_t data_in_len,
		uint32_t *batches_out, 
		uint32_t *height_out, 
		uint32_t *width_out, 
		uint32_t *depth_out, 
		void *data_out,
		uint32_t max_data_out_len,
		uint32_t *data_len_out);

Executes a network, with provided input data and returning output data.

Execution will fail if the network has not been prepared.

Input is provided to the INPUT node, and output is returned from the OUTPUT node.

Returns 0 on success, nonzero otherwise.

	int hexagon_nn_teardown(nn_id id);

Tears down and frees a nn graph.  This can be done at any time after
hexagon_nn_init(), and afterwords the nn_id id will be invalid.

Returns 0 on success, nonzero otherwise.

	struct perfinfo {
		unsigned long node_id;
		unsigned long executions;
		unsigned long counter_lo;
		unsigned long counter_hi;
	};

	int hexagon_nn_get_perfinfo(
		nn_id id,
		hexagon_nn_perfinfo *info_out,
		uint32_t info_out_max_len,
		uint32_t *n_items_returned);

Gets performance info for the nodes.  It fills out the array of perf info
structures.

Returns 0 on success, nonzero otherwise.

	int hexagon_nn_reset_perfinfo(
		nn_id id,
		uint32_t event);

Resets the per-node performance counters, and changes the performance monitor
unit event ID to the specified one.  Event ID 0 counts cycles, event ID 1 and 2 
are defined by the op (and typically unused).  All other event IDs match the
hardware PMU event ID.

Returns 0.

	hexagon_nn_last_execution_cycles(
		nn_id id,
		uint32_t *cycles_lo_out,
		uint32_t *cycles_hi_out)

Returns the total number of processor cycles during execution of
the most recent hexagon_nn_execute() call.
