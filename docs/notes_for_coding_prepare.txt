Notes on adding code to prepare.c 
===========================================
===========================================
( a work in progress, but a good start...)

The 'prepare' process consists of these steps:

 (1) make sure all nodes are in the hash (which is used to map node_id to a node pointer)
 (2) a series of passes which perform graph transformations
 (3) cleanup passes, including
      - dead node removal :all nodes which have no used outputs (with certain exceptions)
	      are removed, until no such nodes exist. There is also a dead node removal pass
		  within step (2)
      - const nodes are brought to the front of the list so they don't need to be executed.
	  - the 'inputs' pointers (to tensors) on nodes are pointed to the proper outputs
	  - memory is allocated to all tensors
	  - the 'check' methods on nodes are called
	  
This document concerns the operations in step (2) - the optimization passes.
Conditions are not the same as when execute methods are called:
   - node->inputs and node->outputs (pointer to tensors) should not be accessed
     except for 
	   (a) Const nodes, which have valid output tensors attached to them when they are created; and 
	   (b) output tensor *shapes* on non-Const nodes (which reflect the max allocated shape;
 	       actual runtime shape could be different). Data pointers are usually NULL.
   - graph connectivity is expressed via each node's input_refs[] array, which gives the src_id and output_idx
     identifying a node output.
   - in 'op' nodes, node->output_defs[idx].rank and .max_sizes[] may be examined to find out what
     dimensions the graph has specified for node outputs; the node->output[idx].shape will have been
     set up in a consistent way ('depth' being the last dimension, according to 'rank'). 
	 
The following invariants must be maintained:
   (a) All nodes referenced in a node's inputs must exist and must be earlier in the list
   (b) Each node must have a unique id;
   (c) the set of nodes in the list must be the same set which is known to the find_node hash
   (d) each node has a 32-bit 'noderefhash' value which is used to help search for input refs. This must
      be consistent with the contents of the node's input_refs array.
	 
   (c) and (d) are maintained by the various utility functions below.	 
	There is a function check_graph which is called a few times during prepare, it checks all of these
	invariants, and a few other things, when debug_level >=1. So it is good to test mods with debug_level>0,
	and see if any errors occur.
	
========================================================
Classes of Modifications
========================================================
Most optimizations consist of three phases, applied at each node:
  [A] determine if there is a match for the particular pattern; and if so,
      extract all of the relevant information needed to make the change.
      This stage doesn't channge the graph at all; so if anything is found which
	  means we can't apply the change, th node can just be skipped over.
  [B] build any new nodes which are needed; these are constructed with assigned node_id's
      and with inputs connected to upstream nodes in the graph (or to other new nodes in
      the pattern).
  [C] apply the change: insert the new node(s) and maybe remove some existing nodes
      There are several utility functions which can used here to make the change in
	  one step while maintaining the invariants. 


There are three basic types of change which can be made in the graph:

(1) adding a new const node. This is generally a sub-operation in phase [B]; if you don't
     add a reference to the new const, it will be removed later. There are some utilities
	 to make it easier to add new consts.
(2) Bypass some part of the graph. If we find AutoQuantize->Dequantize, then this can
    be bypassed; all of the inputs which reference the output of the 'Dequantize' can
	be reconnected the same as the input of the AutoQuantize. This is done by
	searching and modifying the input_refs[] arrays of all the downstream nodes;
	there are some utility functions to do that efficiently while maintaining the noderefhash.
	You don't need to remove the Dequantize; it will be deleted later as a dead node, and
	the AutoQuantize could be removed too, if its output is not used elsewhere.
	
(3) More complex 'pattern replacements'. In such cases, a pattern of one or more nodes is
    found, and then replaced by one or more new nodes. Usually, one of the new nodes will
	'inherit' the node ID of one of the removed nodes; other nodes are given auto-generated
	node ids.	
	In this situation, the new nodes are build with their input references properly set up,
	and then the replacement is done in one step. Sometimes, downstream nodes need to have
	inputs rewired, as in (2) above.
	During the phase [A] of such an operation, you need to make sure that any nodes you
	are going to remove do not drive any other inputs outside the pattern.
	
	
========================================================================
Functions
========================================================================
---------------------------------------------
Functions to look up a node based on node id
---------------------------------------------
struct nn_node * find_node( nn , node_id );

  This finds a node given its ID; returns NULL if not found

  The following shortcuts are provided to simplify common uses of find_node:

	struct nn_node * find_node_must_be( nn , node_id, type_needed);
	  - same as find_node, but will also return NULL if the node's node_type is not type_needed
	  
	struct nn_node * find_node_must_be_Const( nn , node_id);
	  - same as find_node, but will also return NULL if the node's node_type is not OP_Const
	  
	struct nn_node * find_node_must_be_Const_from_ref( nn , struct input const *inref);
	  - same as find_node_must_be_Const, but it reads the node id from inref->src_id; and
	    first checks that inref->output_idx is 0, and will return 0 otherwise.

---------------------------------------------------
Functions to search downstream for 'consumer' nodes
---------------------------------------------------
These are useful in stage [A] of a transformation, to locate nodes which form
part of a pattern, and to check the conditions needed by the pattern.

struct nn_node* find_unique_consumer_anytype(nn, struct nn_node *src, int flags )
	This returns the 'unique consumer' dst of  srcnode, which is the only node such that:
	   (1) no output of src is connected to any node other than dst
	   (2) no inputs of dst are connected to any outputs other than src, or const nodes.
	   
	If no such node exists, it returns NULL.
	If flags includes CONSUMER_NOINCHECK, then condition (2) is not checked (consumer may
	have inputs connected to outputs of other operation nodes).
	
struct nn_node* find_unique_consumer_mustbe(nn, struct nn_node *src, int optype, int flags )
	Just like find_unique_consumer_anytype, except that it will return NULL if dest is not
	of the given type.
	
struct nn_node* find_unique_consumer(nn, struct nn_node *src, int narr, int const *arr, int flags )
	Just like find_unique_consumer_anytype, except that it will return NULL if the node_type of dest
	is not present the supplied array of candidate types: arr[0...narr-1]

int check_single_consumer_all( nn, struct nn_node *producer, struct nn_node *consumer);

	'producer' and 'consumer' are two nodes in the graph.
	returns 0 iff
		- 'consumer' has at least one input connected to an output of producer
		- no other node has inputs connected to output of producer
	returns -1 otherwise

int check_all_outputs( nn, struct nn_node *producer, struct nn_node *consumer);

	check_all_outputs is an alias for check_single_consumer_all, defined in prepare.c
	
	
----------------------------
Functions to add const nodes
----------------------------	
--> You can't change the data in a const node, unless you've first established that it's not connected to
the input of other nodes (e.g. by using check_all outputs). And even then, if you change it you should call 
purge_const_cache(nn, node_id_of_the_const_node_you_channged), to make sure it's not in the cache used by
create_const_float_op and create_const_int32_op. 
	
To add a const node with a single 'int32' or 'float' scalar value (shape = (1,1,1,1), len=4) use one
of :

	uint32_t create_const_float_op(struct nn_graph *nn, float floatval);
	uint32_t create_const_int32_op(struct nn_graph *nn, int32_t intval);

    These functions return a node id.
    These functions 'cache' values, to try to share a const node over multiple uses.
	( 0,-inf and inf are always cached; other values on a 'best effort' basis).
	When needed they use do_prepend_const_node (see below) to make a new const node.
    if the node can't be created, they log a message and return 0.
	
    uint32_t get_zero_node(nn)
    uint32_t get_ninf_node(nn)
    uint32_t get_inf_node(nn)
    - shorthand for create_const_float_op(nn,x) where x = 0.0, -inf, inf
  
To make a node of general size, shape, contents:
    - first use 
	   uint32_t node_id = nn_graph_new_internal_node_id(nn); 
  .. to get a new node id; then use
		 
	int do_prepend_const_node(
		struct nn_graph *nn,
		uint32_t node_id,
		uint32_t batches, uint32_t height, uint32_t width, 	uint32_t depth,
		const uint8_t *data, uint32_t data_len)

    Returns 0 on success.
	This is like an append_const_node API call, except the new node is placed
	 at the start of the list, so it can be referenced from  any op; and it is added to the hash.
	- the data_len can be 0, to make an empty ('shape only') node; data should be NULL.
	- if data_len >0 but data==NULL:
	    the node will be created and allocated with the given size of data, but is not
		initialized. Use find_node(nn,node_id) to locate it so you can fill it in after
		creating it.

-----------------------------------------------
Functions to reconnect inputs of existing nodes
-----------------------------------------------

These functions are used to modify the 'input_refs' fields of downstream nodes,
to connect them to different outputs. The noderefhash values are updated as needed.
( ideally you can find a function here that does all the remapping you need to do in
one pass, to reduce the time spent traversing the list).

It's also possible to just 'manually' modify one or more of the input_refs of a node - whether
the node is in the graph yet or not, provided:
   (1) the new reference id is valid (id !=0, and is earlier in the graph; and output_idx
       is a valid output for the node
   (2) if you change (or may have changed) any of the .src_id on a node, call node_rehash_inputrefs( node*)
       to update the noderefhash, otherwise the find_.._consumer and similar functions could fail.
       node_rehash_inputrefs() is quite low-cost.
  The functions below update the noderefhash automatically (but the condition [1] above is still up to you).


 int change_output_refs( struct nn_graph * nn,
		struct nn_node * begin,	
		uint32_t old_nodeid,
		uint32_t new_nodeid,
		uint64_t pattern );
		- this looks through the list starting from node 'begin' (or the whole list, if begin is NULL)
		   looking for nodes whose inputs reference 'old_nodeid'. These inputs are reconnected to an output
		   of new_nodeid; the index is mapped according to 'pattern', see below.
		   
	  NOTE: this returns <0 on error, or >=0 indicating the number of replacements done.
	  The pattern is used to remap the output index of the reference as below:
	      When we find an input ref with { src_id = old_nodeid, output_idx = i }:
			 nybble = (i>=16)? 0 : (( pattern >> 4*i) &0xF);
			 if( nybble == 0 ) {**error**}
			 else if( nybble ==0xF) { /*don't change it */}
			 else { change ref to { src_id = new_nodeid, output_idx=(nybble-1) } }
			 
	   for instance, pattern = 0xF321 means:
			any input reading from old_nodeid outputs 0,1,2 are remapped to new_nodeid, same output;
			any input reading from old_nodeid output 3 is unchanged;
			any input reading from old_nodeid output >=4 results in an error.
	  

int change_multi_output_refs_table( struct nn_graph * nn,
		struct nn_node * begin,	
		uint32_t old_nodeid,
		int n_outputs,					// number of outputs to rewire
		struct input const new_inpref[] )  // array of new


   This is for rewiring when a single node has been arbitrarily replaced
   by several nodes which supply the results previously generated by 'old_nodeid'.
   'new_inpref[0..n_outputs-1]' is a table of size n_outputs which contains the replacements. 
    
    Operation is:
     -- start at 'begin' (or whole list, if NULL)
     -- look for all node input refs of the form { old_nodeid, idx }
           where idx is in range 0 .. n_outputs-1
     -- change these to new_inpref[idx],  
        but in cases where newnodes[idx].src_id = 0, existing reference are not changed.

int change_multi_output_refs( struct nn_graph * nn,
		struct nn_node * begin,
		uint32_t old_nodeid,
		int n_outputs,					// number of outputs to rewire
		struct nn_node const * newnodes[] )  // array of new nodes to point to [0..n_outputs-1]
		
   This is used when a node with multiple outputs has been converted to d32, and we need to
   remap all references to the node to point to the 'from_d32' nodes. But it could have other
   uses. newnodes[0..n_outputs-1] is a table of struct nn_node * (NULL pointers are allowed, and
   they don't need to be in the graph yet, they just need a valid node_id)

    Operation is:
     -- start at 'begin' (or whole list, if NULL)
     -- look for all node input refs of the form { old_nodeid, idx }
           where idx is in range 0 .. n_outputs-1
     -- change these to { newnodes[idx]->node_id, 0 }  
        but in cases where newnodes[idx]==NULL, existing reference are not changed.
		

-----------------------------------------------
Functions to replace parts of the graph
-----------------------------------------------
Three functions for making local graph transformations.
The first function removes 1 or more nodes from the graph, optionally replacing it by a
single node. The second (optionally) removes 1 node, and replaces by 1 or more nodes.
The third inserts one or more nodes at a given position.
These are done in such a way as to maintain the hash; also, all 'removed' nodes are 
deallocated. Please read carefully:

The following apply to all three functions:

(1) These are #define, using __VARARGS___. The direct function calls are useful
   when the number of nodes to be passed is variable at runtime; they accept a pointer
   to a table of nn_graph *, and a table length. See nn_graph.h for details.
(2) Each has an 'anchor' parameter, which generally points to an nn_node *
   within the linked-list; if NULL, the address of the list head is used. When you
   are deleting at least one node, this is the point at which it will start
   looking for the first node to delete. If you are not deleting any nodes, then
   this is where the new node(s) will be inserted.
(3) The nodes passed as 'new_node' or 'add_node1' etc, must be newly constructed nodes
  (not already in the list); in cases where more than one is passed, they must all
   be distinct. These nodes will be added to the list.
(4) Nodes passed as rm_node, rm_node1 etc must be nodes already in the list (which
   will be removed from the list *and* deallocated).


-->>> replace_nodes: generally this 
	(1) finds rm_node1, starting from 'anchor' as described above;
	(2) removes rm_node_1, and rm_node2,... from the list. If more than one,
	    they MUST be in the order specified (but it's OK if there are other
		nodes between them in the list; these won't be removed).
	(3) inserts new_node at the position where rm_node1 was found.
	(4) updates the node_id hash tables. It is ok if new_node has the same id as
	    one of the removed nodes. Removed nodes are deallocated.
	(5) returns 0 if ok, <0 if error
	
	Other capabilities:
		- 'new_node' may be NULL, in which case the function will only delete the
		  nodes specified in rm_node1, ...
		- any of the rm_node2, ... may be NULL. These are skipped over and ignored.
	       The first, rm_node1, may not be NULL.
		   
  int replace_nodes(
		struct nn_graph *nn,
		struct nn_node ** anchor,	// list anchor, at rm_node1 or upstream
		struct nn_node * new_node,	// replacement node (may be null)
    	struct nn_node * rm_node1, *rm_node2, ...);

-->>> replace_node_with: generally this 
	(1) finds rm_node, starting from 'anchor' as described above;
	(2) removes rm_node from the list
	(3) inserts add_node1, add_node2... at the position where rm_node was found.
	    They will be in that order and contiguous in the list.
	(4) updates the node_id hash tables. It is ok if one of the add_node has the 
	    same id as the removed node. Removed nodes are deallocated.
	(5) returns <0 if error, or the number of nodes inserted (>=0)

	Other capabilities:
		- 'rm_node' may be NULL, in which case the function will just add the nodes
		  specified in add_node1; they will be added at the point specified by anchor 
		  (see also insert_nodes())
		- any or all of the add_node1, ... may be NULL. These are skipped over and ignored.
	       
  int replace_node_with(
		struct nn_graph *nn,
		struct nn_node ** anchor,
		struct nn_node * rm_node,
    	struct nn_node * add_node1, *add_node2, ...);

-->>> insert_nodes:
	(1) inserts add_node1, add_node2... at the position specified by anchor.
	    They will be in that order and contiguous in the list.
	(2) updates the hash node_id hash table.
	(3) returns <0 if error, or the number of nodes inserted (>=0)
     This is identical to calling replace_node_with, with rm_node = NULL.
		- any or all of the add_node1, ... may be NULL. These are skipped over and ignored.

  int insert_nodes(
		struct nn_graph *nn,
		struct nn_node ** anchor,
    	struct nn_node * add_node1, *add_node2, ...);

========================================================================
Order of Optimization Passes
========================================================================

The order is important, since some passes map certain patterns to simpler
patterns which are recognized by later passes. But roughly the order is
   - simplification of certain operations (e.g. more complex patterns which can convert
      to AutoQuantize, or QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange_32to8)
   - There is a pass which converts QuantizedAdd_8p8to32 to QuantizedBiasAdd_8p8to32
     in cases where this makes sense;
   - A very important pass is 'make_supernodes'; this is where supernode patterns
     are detected and changed to supernodes
   - This is followed by some passes that do various specific things
   - Another important pass - convert_to_depth32 - which converts many nodes
     to d32 format.
   - A few cleanup passes after. 'Fake Concat' are created in one of these.

 New operations will be inserted before or after the make_supernodes' pass,
 according to how they interact with supernodes; and most likely before the convert_to_depth32
 pass, unless the pass specifically needs to be after. Most "normal" graphs will not
 have any _d32 ops in them before the convert_to_depth32 pass (graphs made for testing
 often do).

 There are a set of 'class' flags in nn_graph.h which are used to tag operations
 in certain classes; during the early stages of optimization, an 'or' of these
 is made, so that if a certain class of node doesn't exist at all, an entire pass can be
 skipped. Before adding such a flag for a new node, consider whether it can
 be included in that of an existing class.


The code which runs the passes looks like this (excerpt):

	PREPARE_TIME();
	if ((err = remove_unnecessary_quants(nn)) != 0) return err;
	PREPARE_TIME();
	if ((err = remove_unnecessary_dequant_quants(nn)) != 0) return err;
	PREPARE_TIME();
	if( (nn->op_class_set & NN_NODE_FLAG_CLS_CHANSHUFFLE)!= 0){			// any QuantizedChannelShuffle_8 ?
		if ((err = combine_chanshuffle(nn)) != 0) return err;
	}

Here, the 'combine_chanshuffle(nn)' pass is only run if nodes marked NN_NODE_FLAG_CLS_CHANSHUFFLE
are in the list.

The PREPARE_TIME() macros save the cycle counts between each in a table to help understand
how long the passes take; by default this is completely #ifdef'd out, and is not frequently used.
If you insert a new pass you can insert a new PREPARE_TIME to separate it from others, but this
is not necessary. Each 'CHECK(..)' macro also includes a PREPARE_TIME (This has been reworked from
a previous form that resulted in a lot of merge conflicts)


========================================================================
check_graph
========================================================================
Amongst the optimization passes you will see lines like this
	CHECK(GRAPHCHECK_HASH)
... the CHECK expands to 
   if ((err= check_graph(nn,(GRAPHCHECK_HASH)))!=0) return err;

'check_graph' is defined in graph_check.c; it does nothing unless debug_level>=1
 since it is quite time-consuming. The parameter is a set of or'd flags which indicates
 what should be be checked:
     GRAPHCHECK_HASH          - check find_node hash is consistent
     GRAPHCHECK_DEADNODES     - report 'dead' nodes (only used after remove_dead_nodes)
     GRAPHCHECK_NONCONST      - report any nodes out of place wrt nonconst_head_ptr (only used at end)

     Even with flags=0, it will check the following (note that some failures will
     cause it to abandon further checking):
 
    - list is valid (no 'loop'; and 'tail' is within the list, node_count is correct)
    - all nodes have distinct ids
    - Each input reference must refer to a valid output of a node which is earlier
      in the list. This is done without using the find_node hash.
    - Each node's noderefhash is consistent with the input_refs.

  with GRAPHCHECK_NONCONST:
    - nn->nonconst_head_ptr must be in list; all prior nodes must be Const; all
      nodes at and after this point must be non-const.

  with GRAPHCHECK_DEADNODES:
    - each node must have at least one consumer (except for 'exempt' nodes: those
      with NN_NODE_FLAG_RETAIN; this includes all nodes with n_outputs = 0, plus
      a few special things like Assign). This is not considered an error; only
      a log message is produced.

  with GRAPHCHECK_HASH:
    - check that all nodes in the find_node hash are actually in the list.
      If there are nodes in the list which are not in the hash, this is not considered an
      error (they will still be found, but more slowly). But if debug_level > 2, a
      message is always printed like this, indicating how many are in the hash:
        hash ok; 205 of 205 nodes are in hash

If you are testing a fairly complex graph transformation, it is a good
idea to temporarily insert a call to check_graph_check( nn, GRAPHCHECK_HASH) immediately
after your pass, and run with debug_level >= 1.

if hexagon_nn is built with NN_LOG_MAXLEV <=0, the check_graph function 
is entirely omitted from the build.

Note: 
 (1) the nn->tail is a 'weak' tail: it may be null, or it may point to any node
     on the list. Attempts are made to keep it near the end for faster 'append'.
     graph_check only complains if it doesn't meet the weak requirements.
 (2) nn->node_count is defined as an unreliable indication of the number of nodes
     in the list; it will be correct if the utility functions are used to remove &
     insert nodes. But no code relies on it being accurate. graph_check will always
     log a message if it does not match the actual count (and if debug_level > 0).

========================================================================
Etc
========================================================================
 
 When making a replacement pattern, 'output_defs' arrays need to be created
 for new nodes. These can usually be copied from the output_defs
  of nodes being replaced; for cases where this not true, they can be filled
 out as needed (e.g. maybe copy one but then change elementsize). 
 There is a function make_outputdesc_from_shape which will fill one in based
 on a shape and elementsize; the fourth paramater is a flag which was used 
 to indicate when the 'sizes' array needed to be expanded for d32 support; 
 however, this expansion is no longer necessary and the parameter is ignored.

 For the common case where an output will contain a scalar float, you
 can copy that desc from the constant struct value Output_ScalarFloat

 The prepare.c file is thousands of lines. If you need an operation that
 requires a lot of code specific to a single node type, consider putting
 it in a separate file (unfortunately, a few of the functions described above
 are not available outside prepare.c -- probably we should have an nn_prepare.h)
 An example: hexagon/src/metanode_lens_lstm.c

 Code cleanups, other than minor ones, in prepare.c are generally tricky due to
 the potential of creating a conflict with another branch, or the risk of creating
 an unintended side effect. Generally, if you add code which only runs when a certain
 (new) node type exists, the risk of breaking (or impairing) existing graphs should
 be low.
