Purpose:
========
"Smart Wrapper" detects the SOC and automatically loads the correct
Skel library to maximize performance.

"Smart Wrapper" builds on top of "Graph Wrapper" functionality and 
is dependent on those source files.

Source code:
============
    hexagon
       |- host
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_api.c
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_api.h
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_api_impl.c
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_domians_api.c
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_domains_api.h
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_domains_api_impl.c
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_smart_wrapper_api.c
       |    |- hexnn_dsp_smart_wrapper_api.h
       |    |- hexnn_graph_wrapper.cpp
       |    |- hexnn_graph_wrapper.hpp
       |    |_ hexnn_soc_defines.h
       |
       |_ interface
            |_ hexnn_graph_wrapper_interface.h

Interface:
==========
There is no interface change required. Application can use existing call flow.
In order to use this feature, application must only update makefile by including
new files instead of hexagon_nn_stub.c.

Please look at the example makefile under examples/wrapperexample/android.min.
This is a stand-alone application that builds with "Smart Wrapper" turned on
and makes some common hexagon-nn calls.

Prerequisite:
=============
1. All of the prerequisites for building "Graph Wrapper" must be met. Please look
   at docs/graph_wrapper.txt for more information.
